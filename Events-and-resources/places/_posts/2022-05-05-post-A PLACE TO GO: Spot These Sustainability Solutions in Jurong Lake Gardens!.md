Jurong Lake Gardens is Singapore’s first national gardens situated in the heartlands. 

As NParks’ Living Lab, Jurong Lake Gardens is a showcase for sustainable design and smart technology for sustainable operations. 

Keep a lookout for these smart ideas that contribute towards sustainability outcomes and efficient operations that make visiting Jurong Lake Gardens an environmentally friendly and comfortable experience for the community. 

**Cleansing Water Features**

Water features throughout Jurong Lake Gardens don’t just serve up fun for visitors – they also serve an environmentally friendly purpose!

Located adjacent to Jurong Lake, the Gardens has many features such as swales and bioretention basins to cleanse the water runoff from the rain. 

The cleansed rainwater is collected in ponds and used to irrigate the gardens. 

The water is also circulated through phytoremediation ponds and biotopes. These features consist of cleansing cells, which contain aquatic plants in sand beds to filter out particles and clean the water over time.

One example of water-sensitive design is [Clusia Cove](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/juronglakegardens/explore-our-gardens/attractions/clusia-cove), a three-hectare water playground at Lakeside Garden.

Families cooling off at this wet playground would be pleased to know that the water they are playing in is cleansed by natural treatment methods using a water recycling system.

The water in Clusia Cove is in a closed loop circulation that links the cleansing biotope, water playground and eco-pond. Its smart design reduces water usage by recycling the water, while ensuring that its clean and safe to play in!

**Floors from Recycled Shoes**

Did you know that Jurong Lake Gardens incorporates initiatives to upcycle waste material?

Within the [Butterfly Maze](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/juronglakegardens/explore-our-gardens/attractions/butterfly-maze), safety flooring at the end of each slide is made from rubber granules recycled from sport shoes!

Using an environmentally friendly water-based binder, these granules are bound with natural cork to create a safe and aesthetically natural landscape.

Feel the gentle bounce of the ground the next time you slide at the Butterfly Maze!

This green project is initiated and sponsored by the Landscape Industry Association of Singapore and Dow. 

**Strong as a Tree**

Trees aren’t the only wooden features at Jurong Lake Gardens. 

The Multi-Purpose Hall at the upcoming Japanese Garden is constructed from Mass Engineered Timber (MET). 

MET consists of wood products that have been engineered to be stronger than natural wood. Its high strength-to-weight ratio makes it lighter to handle than steel and concrete, allowing it to be installed more easily in less time. 

The building components for the Multi-Purpose Hall are prefabricated at the factory site and transported and assembled at Jurong Lake Gardens. 

MET buildings can be built four times faster than concrete buildings and with less need for cranes. This allows for increased productivity and results in less noise and waste. MET further reduces the use of materials as it can be left exposed without the need to apply a protective coat. 

Look out for the new Multi-Purpose Hall when the redeveloped Japanese Garden opens to visitors!

Observe how the wooden structures span large distances without the need for supporting columns. The unique capability and strength of GLULAM (a type of MET) helps to save space and reduce material use, allowing for a spacious, enjoyable, and environmentally friendly experience at Jurong Lake Gardens!
