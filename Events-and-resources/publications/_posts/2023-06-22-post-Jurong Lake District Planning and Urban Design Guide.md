This Jurong Lake District (JLD) Planning and Urban
Design Guide presents the planning and urban
design considerations for Jurong Lake District to
help guide its future developments.

It aims to visually communicate the desired outcomes of the planning and urban design objectives, and the principles behind the design requirements from planning to implementation details. It should be read together with the relevant land sales requirements and conditions for specific sites and developments.

Please note that all the plans shown in this guide are conceptual and indicative only. Please refer to the URA Master Plan for the specified land use and development intensity of the various sites in JLD.
