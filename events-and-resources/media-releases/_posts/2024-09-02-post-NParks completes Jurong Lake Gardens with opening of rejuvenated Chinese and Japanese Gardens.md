<p>NParks opened the rejuvenated Chinese and Japanese Gardens on 8 September
2024, marking the completion of the development of Jurong Lake Gardens
– Singapore’s first national gardens in the heartlands. Chinese and Japanese
Gardens, along with Lakeside Garden, are the three gardens that make up
the 90 ha Gardens, located within the Jurong Lake District.</p>
<p>With the rejuvenation of Chinese and Japanese Gardens now complete, visitors
can enjoy a refreshed array of features and amenities, including new floral
and aquatic gardens, visitor pavilions and galleries, as well as recreational
and community spaces nestled within a scenic lakeside setting. At the same
time, several familiar landmarks and features at both gardens have been
retained or enhanced for new uses, following feedback by the public supporting
their preservation.</p>
