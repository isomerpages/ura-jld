Singapore, 15 March 2022 – The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has launched a Request for Proposals (RFP) to develop and operate an integrated tourism development at Jurong Lake District.

In 2019, STB announced plans for the development of a 6.8ha site next to Jurong Lake to become a key lifestyle and tourism hub in Singapore’s largest business district outside the CBD. With the launch of the RFP now, STB expects the tourism development to be completed from 2028.

STB expects the new lifestyle and tourism hub to comprise high-quality accommodation as well as a mix of attractions, retail, F&B and entertainment offerings – all with an emphasis on technology, “edutainment” and sustainability. It should complement existing nearby attractions such as the Jurong Lake Gardens and the new Science Centre, and will be well-integrated with the entire Jurong Lake District through a seamless network of pedestrian-friendly streets and well-designed public spaces.

Mr Keith Tan, Chief Executive, Singapore Tourism Board said: “Despite COVID-19, Singapore remains a very attractive destination for business and leisure travellers. While we refresh and rejuvenate existing tourism offerings, we must also create opportunities for investments in new tourism products. The launch of this RFP signals our intent to press ahead with our medium-term plans, so that we can build better for the future.”

Under the Modified Concept and Price Revenue Tender approach, investors are required to submit their concept proposals and tender prices separately.

The tender will be open for seven months, and the closing date for the submission of proposals is 18 October 2022. Companies which indicated their interest during an Expression of Interest exercise for the site in 2019 will also be invited to participate in the tender. Upon the tender award, the entire site will be leased to the successful developer for 60 years.
