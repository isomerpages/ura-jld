<p>As part of URA's Draft Master Plan 2025 review, we are working on a Recreation
Master Plan to support more recreational opportunities.</p>
<p>The Recreation Master Plan focuses on three key areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An Island of Green, Blue and Fun</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyday Play-ces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involving Community in Play</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Between April and July 2024, there will be a series of roving exhibitions
at seven locations across the island to seek publicâ€™s ideas and suggestions
on selected projects and proposals for recreation in their neighbourhoods
and across Singapore. These ideas will be taken into consideration as we
further develop the Recreation Master Plan.</p>
<p>The first exhibition will be held at <strong>Westgate, from 14 to 19 April 2024</strong>.
Do head over to learn about the exciting recreation opportunities around
Jurong Lake District and the wider West Region!</p>
