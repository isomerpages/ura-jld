# Walk your way to better health!

J.Walkers is the first of its kind walking trail that lets you exercise, rain or shine, along a 4km route that links Jurong East MRT Station to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital with Westgate, JEM, IMM and JCube via the J-Walk elevated pedestrian network. 

Taking about 50 minutes to complete, you can brisk walk and window shop at the same time in the cool comfort of the sheltered J.Walkers route. What a great way to clock 5,000 steps in a comfortable and safe environment!

The J.Walkers route is accessible during the operating hours of the malls. Set your target, wear a pair of comfortable shoes and start walking today!

[J.Walkers is an initiative by JurongHealth Fund](https://www.ntfgh.com.sg/Pages/J-Walkers.aspx) in partnership with Health Promotion Board, Urban Redevelopment Authority, IMM, JCube, Westgate and Jem.
