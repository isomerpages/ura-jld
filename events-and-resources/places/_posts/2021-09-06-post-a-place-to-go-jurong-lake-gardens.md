Jurong Lake Gardens is Singapore’s new national gardens, and the first in the heartlands. It is a people’s garden, where spaces have been landscaped and created for families and the community to come together. The gardens contribute to the larger plans for Jurong Lake District in promoting sustainability and a healthy living environment by providing more spaces for recreation amidst lush greenery, restored wetlands and habitats for biodiversity, and with vibrant programming for the community.

The 90-hectare Gardens comprises Lakeside Garden (Jurong Lake Gardens West/former Jurong Lake Park), Chinese and Japanese Gardens (Jurong Lake Gardens Central) and Garden Promenade (Jurong Lake Gardens East). Lakeside Garden opened to visitors in April 2019. The rest of the garden is currently undergoing re-development.
