White Site&nbsp; at Town Hall Link to be Released on 1H2026 Reserve List </h3>

Jurong Lake District will be progressively developed into Singapore’s largest business district outside the city centre to cater to business needs and support decentralisation. It will be a model sustainability district with a goal to achieve net-zero emissions for new developments around 2045. 

Today, the area around the Jurong East MRT interchange station comprises spaces for office, retail and institutional uses. By 2028, a new Jurong Region Line station and an Integrated Transport Hub comprising offices, community spaces and retail amenities will be built next to the Jurong East MRT interchange station. 

The Government will sustain the development momentum at Jurong Lake District, through the release of sites for sale, with the supply carefully paced to take into account economic and market conditions.
 
To catalyse the next phase of development in Jurong Lake District, the Government has decided to release a White site at Town Hall Link for sale via the 1H2026 Reserve List.

The site will be developed in accordance with the Jurong Lake District Planning and Urban Design Guide to ensure that development will be well-coordinated and cohesive with subsequent land parcels in the area to achieve the planning intention for the district. It is also planned for the site to house district level infrastructure – a District Cooling Plant and District Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System Central Station – that will serve future developments in the precinct. The development of the site will activate the use of the district infrastructure to realise the plan for JLD to be a model sustainable district.

With a total potential yield of 186,000 sqm, comprising a minimum of 40,000 sqm of office space, up to 1,200 private residential units and 44,000 sqm GFA of space for complementary uses (e.g. retail, hotel, community uses), the proposed integrated mixed-use development at Town Hall Link will provide the critical mass needed to catalyse the next phase of development for JLD and help cater to medium term growth in demand across market segments. Accessibility to the proposed development will be enhanced with the expected opening of the Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line stations in JLD in 2028 and 2032 respectively.
