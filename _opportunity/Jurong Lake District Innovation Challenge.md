# About the Jurong Lake District Innovation challenge

To realise our sustainability ambition, we must work with relevant stakeholders such as landlords, businesses, residents, and urban solution providers to innovate and experiment with new ideas and solutions to shape our collective, sustainable future.

We are calling for all start-ups, companies, institutes of higher learning, and research institutes to propose novel solutions to address the sustainability challenges facing the district.

Our partners in Jurong Lake District have come together to share their challenge statements, under the key themes below:

**Low Carbon**

All new buildings in Jurong Lake District will be required to minimally achieve [Green Mark Platinum (Super Low Energy) certification.](https://www1.bca.gov.sg/buildsg/sustainability/green-mark-certification-scheme) Existing building owners are also actively seeking ways to reduce their energy consumption. Reducing the carbon footprint of the district will be a combined effort by residents, businesses and visitors; and should be made fun, educational and hassle-free.

Today, getting to Jurong Lake District is convenient using the established public transport network. By the 2030s, Jurong Lake District will be even more connected with four MRT lines serving it and at least 85% of all trips targeted to be made by Walk-Cycle-Ride modes of transport in 2035. We are seeking to implement a mix of strategies from infrastructural enhancements to behavioural nudges to make car-lite an integral part of everyone’s lifestyle choices in Jurong Lake District.
