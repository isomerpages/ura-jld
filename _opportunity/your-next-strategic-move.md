<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Office quantum in key business centres</h3>

Amidst a fast-changing landscape, our commitment remains steadfast. Investors can be confident in the government’s commitment to focus investment and development in Jurong Lake District for the next two decades.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Precinct plan</h3>

The current commercial core comprises mainly offices, retail and institution uses. By 2028, we can look forward to more offices and community uses, a new Jurong Region Line station and two new bus interchanges (Jurong East Integrated Transport Hub and Bus Interchange at Venture Drive) to further enhance bus connectivity.

The commercial core will extend seamlessly into a new 120-hectare precinct, which will have a balanced mix of offices, housing, and amenities in a car-lite and park setting. This precinct will be developed over the next 30 years and served by two new MRT stations. We will have the opportunity to introduce new development concepts and redesign ways to integrate live, work and play. 

International Business Park is Singapore’s pioneer business park supporting R&amp;D and knowledge-based activities since the 1990s. In the coming years, the business park will be progressively rejuvenated with more mixed uses to support the needs of new economic sectors and complement the commercial core. The area around the upcoming Jurong Town Hall MRT station will also see more mixed uses to cater to the thriving tech community. 

Jurong Lake Gardens is Singapore’s third national garden and a collection of three unique gardens. A new Science Centre and tourist development will add to the attractions at Lakeside Garden, Chinese Garden and Japanese Garden. This will make Jurong Lake District a place for leisure and recreation and a destination for events and entertainment.
