<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Precinct plan</h3>

Jurong Gateway is the current commercial core of Jurong Lake District, comprising mainly offices, retail and institution uses. By 2028, we can look forward to more offices and community uses, a new Jurong Region Line station and an integrated transport hub next to Jurong East MRT station.

The commercial core will extend seamlessly into Lakeside East, which will have a balanced mix of offices, housing and amenities in a car-lite and park setting. This 120-hectare precinct will be developed over the next 30 years and served by two new MRT stations. We will have the opportunity to experiment with new development concepts and redesign ways to integrate live, work and play.

International Business Park is Singapore’s pioneer business park supporting R&amp;D and knowledge-based activities since the 1990s. In the coming years, the business park will be progressively rejuvenated to support the needs of new economic sectors and complement the commercial core. The area around the upcoming Jurong Town Hall MRT station will also see more mixed uses to cater to the thriving tech community.

Lakeside West embraces Jurong Lake and Singapore’s third national garden, Jurong Lake Gardens - a collection of three unique gardens. A new science centre and tourist development will add to the attractions at Lakeside Garden, Chinese Garden and Japanese Garden. This will make Lakeside West a place for leisure and recreation and a destination for events and entertainment.
