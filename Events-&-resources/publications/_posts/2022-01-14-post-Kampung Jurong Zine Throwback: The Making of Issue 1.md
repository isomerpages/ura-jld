Kampung Jurong Zine is a local magazine for the Yuhua neighbourhood in Jurong Lake District.

Inspired by the distinct identities of the neighbourhoods in Tokyo and the thought that one could map a community through people and stories, the founders - [KAMPUNGMAKERS](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung) are exploring the potential such community stories can have in deepening intergenerational connectivity and social health.

Conceptualised by creators Ong Yuqi and Pok Yue Weng, and catalysed by Bold at Work over 4 months in 2019, 6 contributors underwent workshops and a guided trail to explore their personal point of interest in Jurong. The inaugural edition of Kampung Jurong is a collection of photo interviews, essays and poems as an ode to Jurong, featuring its rooftop gardens, ang ku kuehs and brutalist architecture.
