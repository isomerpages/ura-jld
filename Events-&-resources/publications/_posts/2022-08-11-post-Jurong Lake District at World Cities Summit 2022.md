The World Cities Summit (WCS) 2022 was held from 31 July to 3 August 2022 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.

The biennial event is a platform for government leaders and industry experts to address liveable and sustainable city challenges, share urban solutions and forge new partnerships. WCS is jointly organised by Singapore’s Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).

Themed **_Liveable and Sustainable Cities: Emerging Stronger_**, WCS 2022 sought to address how might cities remain liveable, sustainable, and more resilient in these trying, unsettling times of pandemic and climate change.

URA participated in the Singapore Pavilion where we put the spotlight on **Jurong Lake District** as **A Place To Grow**.
