The World Cities Summit (WCS) 2022 was held from 31 July to 3 August 2022 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.

The biennial event is a platform for government leaders and industry experts to address liveable and sustainable city challenges, share urban solutions and forge new partnerships. WCS is jointly organised by Singapore’s Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).

Themed **_Liveable and Sustainable Cities: Emerging Stronger_**, WCS 2022 sought to address how might cities remain liveable, sustainable, and more resilient in these trying, unsettling times of pandemic and climate change.

URA participated in the Singapore Pavilion where we put the spotlight on Jurong Lake District as **A Place To Grow**.

URA’s stand featured Jurong Lake District as Singapore’s largest mixed use business district outside the city centre and a key instrument in our decentralisation efforts. We showcased how Jurong Lake District, as a district of gardens and water and a model for urban sustainability, demonstrates a holistic approach to sustainability through urban planning and design, sustainable transport, district infrastructure, green buildings and active communities.

The exhibition received interest from local and overseas visitors, including city leaders, urban planning professionals, academics and researchers, urban solutions providers, and real estate investors.

Of particular interest were our sustainability ambitions for Jurong Lake District and our strong commitment to making sustainability a way of life in the district. Our renders and infographics on sustainable developments and green buildings - newly developed by our in-house teams, came in handy for explaining how URA works in partnership with our public and private sector stakeholders to realise our ambition for Jurong Lake District as a model sustainable and net zero district. Strategies include providing for and implementing sustainability infrastructure such as a District Cooling System and District Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System, and designing key roads as Transit Priority Corridors with bus-only lanes, cycling paths and wider footpaths to make commuting by walk-cycle-ride modes more convenient and comfortable.

Visitors also showed keen interest in the new developments in Jurong Lake District, namely the upcoming Integrated Transport Hub and Jurong Region Line stations currently under construction, the upcoming New Science Centre and future Tourism Development, and the rejuvenation of the Chinese and Japanese Gardens at Jurong Lake Gardens. The exhibition provided an excellent space to discuss business and investment opportunities in the district.

URA is proud to be part of the Singapore Pavilion at World Cities Summit 2022.

We look forward to more opportunities to showcase our plans for Jurong Lake District in making it
**A Place To Grow**.
