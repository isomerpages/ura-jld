Kampung Jurong Zine is a local magazine for the Yuhua neighbourhood in Jurong Lake District. 

Inspired by the distinct identities of the neighbourhoods in Tokyo and the thought that one could map a community through people and
stories, the founders - [KAMPUNGMAKERS](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung), are exploring the potential such community stories can have in deepening intergenerational connectivity and social health.

In light of COVID-19 and the Circuit Breaker measures, [**Kampung Jurong Issue 2**](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-2) turns the focus to the Jurong-based businesses affected by the pandemic. 8 contributors came onboard to mine stories and interview business owners to explore how opportunities arose from change. At the end of the 3 months, the contributors were rewarded with their spirit of adaptability and generosity. Jurong continually inspires us with its self-sufficient way of life.

The launch of Issue 2 in 2020 took the form of a guided trail to extend the conversation beyond paper and to create tangible outcomes for the business owners. Trail participants got a taste of the food samplings, as well as a kueh making session with Wonderyam.

Read how the [stories in Issue 2](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-2) honour the heroes and voices of the Jurong heartland, and bring to fore the spirit of cheerful self-sufficiency that is this neighbourhood's way of life.

**About KAMPUNGMAKERS**

[KAMPUNGMAKERS](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung) is a collaborative platform where creators of different backgrounds intersect, explore and express a community's identity. The output of every collaboration is a publication made available to the public. In every edition, KAMPUNGMAKERS explores a different theme and archives the narrative through a dialogue-driven and socially engaged process. 

As a simultaneous act of finding and making of identity, KAMPUNGMAKERS serves as a space for contributors to have an internal excavation of their ideas and voices, and an external excavation of stories in the community. It hopes that the publication could evoke in readers a deeper consciousness about the idea of community and invite them to re-look at ordinary spaces with a greater sense of wonder.
