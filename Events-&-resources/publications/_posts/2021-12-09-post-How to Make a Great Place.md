The vibrancy of our spaces enhances our connection and appreciation towards places, that is why placemaking efforts are important. 

This first-ever book by Urban Redevelopment Authority on placemaking in Singapore charts these efforts over the last two decades, and shares various experiences from our designers, architects, planners, and placemaking community.

Indeed, placemaking must take a collaborative approach, with public, private and people sectors coming together to enliven our public spaces. Successful placemaking is more than just getting stakeholders to organise or coordinate activities, it is about drawing in the community and meaningfully involving people in the activities. 

COVID-19 has brought about challenges in how we interact with one another and has impacted how our public spaces are designed and planned. More than ever, we need to find creative and new ways to forge stronger connections with the community. 

We are very proud that Jurong has been accorded a special section from Pages 170 to 177 to showcase the passion from our placemaking community here. Read about efforts from members in this network in creating good community spaces at J-Link, J.Connect, Jurong Lake Gardens, Taman Jurong, Yuhua and even along the J.Walk. We banded through common interests to create movements for health and sustainability, and to readily respond to one another to render assistance, support and partnerships. 

As Jurongâ€™s physical landscape continues to evolve, we look forward to growing our placemaking efforts in tandem to continue making Jurong Lake District a distinctive neighbourhood in the west and A Place To Grow.
