This feature on Jurong Lake District is an excerpt from Singapore's methodical approach to becoming a net-zero city. 

The article sets out how Singapore has long taken the approach of adopting innovations methodically, and its approach to becoming a net-zero city is no different. 

Jurong Lake District is one of the four case studies that show how an integrated approach can be used to promote greater sustainability. 

It recognises that every city will have a different journey to net zero, but Singapore could provide one model for others to follow.

Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, Singaporeâ€™s second largest business district, Jurong Lake District, has been identified as a model for urban sustainability. 

It is planned as a car-light district where at least 85% of all trips will be made by either on foot, bike or public transport. The district will also be ready for autonomous and electric vehicles.

The blueprint of the district will aim for zero emissions and waste, and will optimize land use through centralised infrastructure including a cooling system and a pneumatic waste conveyance system. 

The district has also adopted the [Built Environment Living Lab Framework](https://www1.bca.gov.sg/buildsg/enabling-innovation-adoption/be-llf), a regulatory enabler that allows for developers and businesses to work together to pilot sustainability innovations.
