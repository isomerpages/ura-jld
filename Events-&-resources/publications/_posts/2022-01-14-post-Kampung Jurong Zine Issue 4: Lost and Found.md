Kampung Jurong Zine is a local magazine for the Yuhua neighbourhood in Jurong Lake District.

Inspired by the distinct identities of the neighbourhoods in Tokyo and the thought that one could map a community through people and stories, the founders - [KAMPUNGMAKERS](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung) are exploring the potential such community stories can have in deepening intergenerational connectivity and social health.

Titled [**Lost and Found, Kampung Jurong Issue 4**](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-3) is part of a intergenerational series produced in collaboration with the seniors of [Loving Heart Multi-service Centre](https://lovingheart.org.sg/). The publications were distributed across different community institutions in Jurong.

Heritage is often recounted on a grand scale. However, much of our identity comprises of smaller everyday objects that elude our collective memory and archive. 

Issue 4 is an ode to the heritage behind ordinary preloved objects and traces its renewed lives with new owners.

Five youth contributors are paired with five seniors who have objects they are ready to part with. The youth contributors then inherit a selected item respectively and explore its renewed life from their personal point of view, and the hidden narratives that come along with it. 

Delve into the lives and memories of these Yuhua seniors as they [tell their stories](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-3) of what these objects mean to them.
