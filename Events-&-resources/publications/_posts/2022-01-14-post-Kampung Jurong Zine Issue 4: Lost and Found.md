Kampung Jurong Zine is a local magazine for the Yuhua neighbourhood in Jurong Lake District.

Inspired by the distinct identities of the neighbourhoods in Tokyo and the thought that one could map a community through people and stories, the founders - [KAMPUNGMAKERS](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung) are exploring the potential such community stories can have in deepening intergenerational connectivity and social health.

Titled [**Lost and Found, Kampung Jurong Issue 4**](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-3) is part of a intergenerational series produced in collaboration with the seniors of [Loving Heart Multi-service Centre](https://lovingheart.org.sg/). The publications were distributed across different community institutions in Jurong.

Heritage is often recounted on a grand scale. However, much of our identity comprises of smaller everyday objects that elude our collective memory and archive. 

Issue 4 is an ode to the heritage behind ordinary preloved objects and traces its renewed lives with new owners.

Five youth contributors are paired with five seniors who have objects they are ready to part with. The youth contributors then inherit a selected item respectively and explore its renewed life from their personal point of view, and the hidden narratives that come along with it. 

Delve into the lives and memories of these Yuhua seniors as they [tell their stories](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-3) around the questions of how do we ascribe value to an object, and what are the things that elude our collective memory and archive? As you 
explore these questions, KAMPUNGMAKERS invites you to contemplate and imagine the possibilities of an alternative economy. 

**About KAMPUNGMAKERS**

[KAMPUNGMAKERS](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung) is a collaborative platform where creators of different backgrounds intersect, explore and express a communityâ€™s identity. The output of every collaboration is a publication made available to the public. In every edition, KAMPUNGMAKERS explores a different theme and archives the narrative through a dialogue-driven and socially engaged process.

As a simultaneous act of finding and making of identity, KAMPUNGMAKERS serves as a space for contributors to have an internal excavation of their ideas and voices, and an external excavation of stories in the community. It hopes that the publication could evoke in readers a deeper consciousness about the idea of community and invite them to re-look at ordinary spaces with a greater sense of wonder.
