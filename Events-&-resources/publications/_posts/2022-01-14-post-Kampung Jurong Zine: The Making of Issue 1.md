Kampung Jurong Zine is a local magazine for the Yuhua neighbourhood in Jurong Lake District.

Inspired by the distinct identities of the neighbourhoods in Tokyo and the thought that one could map a community through people and stories, the founders - [KAMPUNGMAKERS](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung) are exploring the potential such community stories can have in deepening intergenerational connectivity and social health.
