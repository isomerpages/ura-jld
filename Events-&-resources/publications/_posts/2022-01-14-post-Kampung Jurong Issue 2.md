*Kampung Jurong Zine* is a local magazine for the Yuhua neighbourhood in Jurong Lake District. 

Inspired by the distinct identities of the neighbourhoods in Tokyo and the thought that one could map a community through people and
stories, the founders - Kampungmakers, are exploring the potential such community stories can have in deepening intergenerational connectivity and social health.
