Kampung Jurong Zine is a local magazine for the Yuhua neighbourhood in Jurong Lake District. 

Inspired by the distinct identities of the neighbourhoods in Tokyo and the thought that one could map a community through people and
stories, the founders - [Kampungmakers](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung), are exploring the potential such community stories can have in deepening intergenerational connectivity and social health.

In light of COVID-19 and the Circuit Breaker measures, [**Kampung Jurong Issue 2**](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-2) turns the focus to the Jurong-based businesses affected by the pandemic. 8 contributors came onboard to mine stories and interview business owners to explore how opportunities arose from change. At the end of the 3 months, the contributors were rewarded with their spirit of adaptability and generosity. Jurong continually inspires us with its self-sufficient way of life.

The launch of Issue 2 in 2020 took the form of a guided trail to extend the conversation beyond paper and to create tangible outcomes for the business owners. Trail participants got a taste of the food samplings, as well as a kueh making session with Wonderyam.
