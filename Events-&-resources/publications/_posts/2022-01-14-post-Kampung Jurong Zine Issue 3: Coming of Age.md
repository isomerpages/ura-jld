Kampung Jurong Zine is a local magazine for the Yuhua neighbourhood in Jurong Lake District.

Inspired by the distinct identities of the neighbourhoods in Tokyo and the thought that one could map a community through people and stories, the founders - [KAMPUNGMAKERS](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung), are exploring the potential such community stories can have in deepening intergenerational connectivity and social health.

Titled [**Coming of Age, Kampung Jurong Issue 3**](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-3) is part of a intergenerational series produced in collaboration with the seniors of [Loving Heart Multi-service Centre](https://lovingheart.org.sg/). The publications were distributed across different community institutions in Jurong.

The topic of aging is commonly associated with the elderly but rarely drawn in comparison to the process of growing up. KAMPUNGMAKERS extended the conversation of aging to youths, and facilitate an intergenerational dialogue on aging and imagining an age-friendly society. 

[Issue 3](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-3) is a guide to aging that showcases the reflections of five pairings of youth and elderly as they explore thematic questions on aging and growing up. 

The publication is divided into two parts- the first half features the articles / works by the youths, while the other half features the elderly's perspectives in elderly-friendly text. 

All the works were synthesised into a guide to aging, printed in the middle section of the publication.
