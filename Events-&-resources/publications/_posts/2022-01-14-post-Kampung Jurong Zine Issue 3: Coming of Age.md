Kampung Jurong Zine is a local magazine for the Yuhua neighbourhood in Jurong Lake District.

Inspired by the distinct identities of the neighbourhoods in Tokyo and the thought that one could map a community through people and stories, the founders - [KAMPUNGMAKERS](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung) are exploring the potential such community stories can have in deepening intergenerational connectivity and social health.

Titled [**Coming of Age, Kampung Jurong Issue 3**](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-3) is part of a intergenerational series produced in collaboration with the seniors of [Loving Heart Multi-service Centre](https://lovingheart.org.sg/). The publications were distributed across different community institutions in Jurong.

The topic of ageing is commonly associated with the elderly but rarely drawn in comparison to the process of growing up. KAMPUNGMAKERS extended the conversation of ageing to youths, and facilitated an intergenerational dialogue on ageing and imagining an age-friendly society. 

[Issue 3](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-3) is a guide to ageing that showcases the reflections of five pairings of youth and elderly as they explore thematic questions on ageing and growing up.

The publication is divided into two parts- the first half features the articles / works by the youths, while the other half features the elderly's perspectives in elderly-friendly text. 

All the works were synthesised into a guide to ageing, printed in the middle section of the publication.

Come read these [conversations](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung/issue-3) in Jurong on how do you know you have grown old and what does it mean to age well. As you explore these questions, KAMPUNGMAKERS invites you to come onboard and re-examine our notions towards ageing, and reimagine the possibilities that come with it.

**About KAMPUNGMAKERS**

[KAMPUNGMAKERS](https://aboldkampung.wixsite.com/kampung) is a collaborative platform where creators of different backgrounds intersect, explore and express a communityâ€™s identity. The output of every collaboration is a publication made available to the public. In every edition, KAMPUNGMAKERS explores a different theme and archives the narrative through a dialogue-driven and socially engaged process.

As a simultaneous act of finding and making of identity, KAMPUNGMAKERS serves as a space for contributors to have an internal excavation of their ideas and voices, and an external excavation of stories in the community. It hopes that the publication could evoke in readers a deeper consciousness about the idea of community and invite them to re-look at ordinary spaces with a greater sense of wonder.
