Did you know that by giving blood, you can save not one but three lives in 60 minutes? 

As part of Good Neighbour Day 2021, JurongHealth Campus is inviting corporations and individuals to give back to the community through making a blood donation. 

Take that step towards saving life by making an appointment with Bloodbank@Westgate Tower to donate blood!

Or how about bringing along a family member or friend to the [Blood Community Drive](https://giveblood.sg/) at Jurong West on 28 December? Walk in at Team Nila @ Jurong West Sports Centre from 1.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. 

The power to save lives is in our hands, so long as we bravely take the next step. We all can be good neighbours to one another! All we need to do is to take that next step forward, from wherever we stand!
