**About MOLLY the Mobile Library**

As part of the National Library Board’s commitment to promote reading and making books available to all children, MOLLY® the Mobile Library provide access to a large collection of children’s books, along with services like book borrowing and returning, at selected pre-schools, Special Education (SPED) schools, or communities with little access to libraries.

MOLLY® the Mobile Library comprises of one big MOLLY bus and two mini-MOLLY buses, which carry thousands of books and visit special education centres and pre-schools, kindergartens and childcare centres in the Housing and Development Board (HDB) estates.

The latest edition – MOLLY® 3 – is equipped with new features such as a wheelchair lift, a magnetic whiteboard for activity sessions, and customised child-friendly book stations at a convenient height for young readers that allow children to borrow and return books by themselves.

This event is brought to you through a collaboration between NParks and National Library Board.
