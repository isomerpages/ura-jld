Arts in Your Neighbourhood is an initiative by the National Arts Council to bring enriching arts experiences to everyone at their doorsteps. From 11 to 28 November, explore familiar spaces through fresh eyes with interactive and family-friendly experiences as Arts in Your Neighbourhood heads to Jurong, Bukit Merah, Marine Parade, Serangoon, Tampines and more!

Programme highlights in Jurong include **A Fisherman's Dream**, a colourful art trail that brings to life the lesser-known histories and tales of Jurong by *Tell Your Children*. Be inspired by our feathered friends at **A Bird Colouring Social Club** - a digital experience by *Kronoscapes* at Jurong Lake Gardens.

Arts in Your Neighbourhood is organised by the National Arts Council and made possible in Jurong with the support of our partners at Jurong Lake Gardens, Jurong Regional Library, Taman Jurong Community Club, Jurong-Clementi Town Council and Heartland Enterprise Centre Singapore.
