Each edition of BIG features gardening talks and workshops for all ages. Enjoy free garden tours, exciting programmes, and craft and educational activities for children. 

For October, listen to the folktale about a boy who grew the most beautiful flowers, learn from the experts on how to grow edibles and create your own Bonsai, and take part in our guided tours at the gardens.

We look forward to seeing you online and in Jurong Lake Gardens for an exciting day ahead! 

BIG runs from 8 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. Registration is on first-come-first-serve basis.
