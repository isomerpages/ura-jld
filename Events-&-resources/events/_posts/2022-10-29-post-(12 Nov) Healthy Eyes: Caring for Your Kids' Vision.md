**Myopia is the main focus at this fun, educational event for children and their parents!**

**About the Programme:**

Myopia is the main focus at this event that is recommended for children aged 7 to 12 years old, and their parents.

Participants will get to hear from a consultant from the Singapore National Eye Centre about childhood myopia and its treatment options, and can get their questions on the topic addressed at a Q&A session. 

There are also various booths by industry partners such as CooperVision, EssilorLuxottica and Johnson & Johnson Vision, featuring displays of myopia treatment tools and hands-on exhibits for participants to try out. The industry partners will also give presentations on myopia, and participants can speak directly to them at their booths.

A limited number of goodie bags is available for registered participants on a first-come, first-served basis.
