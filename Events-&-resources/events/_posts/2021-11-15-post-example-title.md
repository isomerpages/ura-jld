Before the 1960s, Jurong was largely a swampy and forested area where plantations were common. How then did Jurong transform into the lively district that it is today?

Curated and produced by *Tell Your Children*, **A Fisherman's Dream** is a neighbourhood art trail through central Jurong that retells the vibrant history of the estate through a series of 8 colourful murals and installations.
