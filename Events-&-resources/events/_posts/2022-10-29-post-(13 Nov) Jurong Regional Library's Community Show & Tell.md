**Let’s meet and be inspired!**

**About the Event**

_Community Show & Tell_ welcomes people from all walks of life from the community to come together, exchange ideas and interests, and learn from one another. It also celebrates the people who have added to the vibrancy of our libraries and archives. Let’s meet and be inspired.

**About the Speakers**

*   Chin Hoong trained as a Chemical Engineer, is a full-time stay at home mom, and a part-time environmentalist. She enjoys reading, swimming, and dreams of the day when she doesn't need to chase her kids to do homework.
*   Chester and family started a community initiative, The Caterpillar Library, when his child asked, "Can we build a library?" The idea was a seed planted by a child. As it grows over the years, it continues to be nurtured by kind people all around us. 
*   Cheng Puay is a biologist and an educator, and is currently the Head of Global Readiness in the Centre for Experiential Learning in the Singapore University of Social Sciences. As a volunteer with the NUS Toddycats for over 20 years, he regularly engages the public as a nature guide and helps coordinate coastal clean-ups with International Coastal Clean-up Singapore (ICCS).
*   Cuifen started making compost heaps with her neighbours in 2014. Through her curious explorations and interactions with other people, she's since started composting initiatives at five locations. Her community projects include Boon Lay Nature Garden and Project Black Gold. Cuifen co-creates a social venture (Food Citizen) where she and others bring compost lessons to schools, businesses, and communities.
