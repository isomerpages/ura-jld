What makes up a Smart Nation? What are the technologies powering Singapore’s Smart Nation initiatives?

Smart Nation is about transforming Singapore through digital technologies. These technologies play a critical role in reshaping the way we live, work, and play. Jointly developed by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) and Science Centre Singapore, the Smart Nation PlayScape exhibition seeks to demystify technology and inspire Singaporeans to be curious about future technologies through a series of fun and immersive interactives.

The exhibition consists of eight technology zones. Through a series of gamified exhibits and multimedia elements, each zone gives an in-depth yet easy to understand explanation on how the technology came about, how it works, and its importance to Singapore today.

The exhibition also provides an opt-in personalised experience, whereby one could collect digital stamps and snapshots of his/her own PlayScape journey through the various exhibits and get a soft copy of the digital ‘PlayScape Passport’ via email.

**Highlights**

**Geospatial**

Geospatial technology helps us better understand where things are in relation to one another, and how it can help us plan and build thriving communities.

Add blocks representing different elements such as schools, houses, parks to the city, and observe how the quality-of-life changes!

Do you appear ‘happier’ than your friends? Through biometric technology, computers can analyse your face and determine who makes the best expression!
