Themed ‘Enlivening Public Spaces’, the 3rd cycle of the URA-REDAS SPARK Challenge continues to involve the public in contributing to the activation of our public and retail spaces with original and creative ideas.

To involve the public in contributing to the activation of our public and retail spaces, original and creative ideas submitted for the Challenge have been shortlisted and transformed into experiential installations in participating Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) and precincts for public enjoyment.

Fill My Little World is one of the 5 original and creative ideas to be transformed into experiential installations at JCube, Jem, IMM and Westgate.

Fill My Little World is both an art installation and interactive social space for finding a quick escape from the frenzy and buzz of a shopping spree. Shoppers are invited to connect to their BODY AND SOUL through "Fitting Rooms" that bring unexpected joy and delight.

Fill My Little World provides fresh, interesting, and memorable experiences for visitors and shoppers at IMM, Jem and JCube, and contributes towards our local stakeholders’ efforts to enhance the vibrancy and attractiveness of these spaces at Jurong Gateway.
