Are you interested in making a difference in Jurong Lake District?

‘Design Prototyping for the Public Realm’ - the 3rd edition of the URA-REDAS SPARK Challenge is a competition that seeks ground-up innovation to raise the quality of the built environment. 

To involve the public in contributing to the activation of our public and retail spaces, original and creative ideas submitted for the Challenge will be shortlisted and transformed into experiential installations in participating Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) and precincts for public enjoyment.

We are looking for original and creative ideas to transform into experiential installations at JCube, Jem, IMM and Westgate. Your creations will provide fresh, interesting, and memorable experiences for visitors and shoppers at these popular shopping malls at Jurong Gateway. Come contribute towards our local stakeholders’ efforts to enhance the vibrancy and attractiveness of these spaces in Jurong!

URA-REDAS SPARK Challenge is organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore.
