Bazaar In the Garden @ Jurong Lake Gardens takes place on every fourth Saturday of the month!

The sessions start in the morning, where you can kick-start your day with us through fun programmes to learn more about the biodiversity in Jurong Lake Gardens. 

In the afternoon, participants can learn from our speakers on a variety of gardening topics and craft, such as growing edibles in your own high-rise apartments and creating floral displays using kitchenware and edibles!
