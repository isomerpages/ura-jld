Be a good neighbour to friends and families in Jurong Lake District and the west!

As part of the community in the west, JurongHealth Campus has been hosting Good Neighbour Day annually since 2015. This special event provides corporations, individuals and our staff a platform to give back to the community and the opportunity to come together to show kindness and reach out to non-profit organisations operating in our neighbourhood.

Come 3 December 2021, find out how you can make a difference to our community and the environment. 

**Programme Highlights**
* Spotlight on good works of community partners in our neighbourhood
* Recycle pre-loved items to The Salvation Army
* Donate books and support youths with special needs
