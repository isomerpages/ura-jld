Are you interested in making a difference in your built environment?

Entitled ‘Design Prototyping for the Public Realm’, the 3rd edition of the URA-REDAS SPARK Challenge is a competition that seeks ground-up innovation to raise the quality of the built environment. 

To involve the public in contributing to the activation of our public and retail spaces, original and creative ideas submitted for the Challenge will be shortlisted and transformed into experiential installations in participating Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) and precincts for public enjoyment.

This year, URA and REDAS are partnering with BIDs and precincts to provide fresh, interesting, and memorable experiences for visitors and shoppers who frequent the shopping malls and mixed-use developments within the area. This is closely aligned with local stakeholders’ efforts to develop and implement ground-up placemaking ideas to enhance the vibrancy and attractiveness of these spaces.

For this edition, the prototypes will be hosted in development and malls from the Orchard and Jurong Gateway Precincts, as well as participating pilot Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) of Marina Central and Paya Lebar Central.
