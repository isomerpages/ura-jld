J.Walkers is the first of its kind walking trail that lets you exercise, rain or shine, along a 4km route that links Jurong East MRT Station to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital with Westgate, JEM, IMM and JCube via the J-Walk elevated pedestrian network. 

Walk, jog or run at your own pace or with a group of 5 friends and family in the virtual event and challenge yourself to complete 50,000 steps or 100,000 steps.
