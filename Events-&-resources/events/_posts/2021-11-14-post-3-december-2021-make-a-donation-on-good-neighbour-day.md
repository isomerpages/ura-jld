Everyone can be a good neighbour!

In support of SG Cares Giving Week, JurongHealth Campus is calling for donations for Good Neighbour Day on 3 December 2021. This special event provides corporations and individuals a platform to give back to the community and the opportunity to come together to show kindness and reach out to non-profit organisations operating in our neighbourhood.

Every effort counts! Come 3 December 2021, find out how you can:

* Donate groceries, household, masks and stationery items to help needy residents in the west
* Give your books a new lease of life
* Recycle your pre-loved apparel and toys!
