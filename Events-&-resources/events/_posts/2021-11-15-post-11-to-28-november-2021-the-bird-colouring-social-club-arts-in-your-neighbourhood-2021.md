Calling the young and young at heart! Gather in celebration of our feathered friends in this exhibition inspired by the bird singing competitions and clubs that gave communities a reason to come together in the 1960s. Join us in bringing the area to life – just as bird singing once did for HDB void decks and open fields. Simply colour in pages that feature Singapore’s garden and urban birds, have your finished works scanned, and spot your creation in 3D in the exhibition’s digital aviary.

**Jurong Lake Gardens - Entrance Pavilion**

11, 12, 15 - 19, 22 - 26 Nov (3 - 8pm)
