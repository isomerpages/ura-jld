On 1 April 2023, the National Parks Board (NParks) completed the development of Lakeside Garden, one of three gardens within the 90-hectare Jurong Lake Gardens, along with the upcoming Chinese and Japanese Gardens.

Located in the western part of the Gardens, the 60-ha Lakeside Garden has a new northern section that serves as its newest active zone. It features the biggest outdoor skate park in Singapore, situated amidst recreated forest habitats interspersed with wetland pools. The skate park is also the first in Singapore with a parkour park and bouldering wall, and was designed in close consultation with the community.

The new active zone expands the variety of experiences for visitors of all ages at Lakeside Garden, advancing the Gardens’ vision of being a people’s garden.
