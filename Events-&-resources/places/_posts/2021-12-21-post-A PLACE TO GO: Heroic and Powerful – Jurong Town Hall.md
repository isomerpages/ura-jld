Tan Kok Hiang, principal director of Forum Architects, lets us in on what it takes to restore Jurong Town Hall, an icon of modern architecture.

Jurong Town Hall was very heroic and powerful. It had something to say,” says Tan. In 2017, his firm, Forum Architects, completed a detailed restoration of the iconic Jurong Town Hall, which has become a significant landmark and symbol of Singapore’s successful industrialisation efforts.

Completed in 1974, Jurong Town Hall served as the headquarters of Jurong Town Corporation (currently known as JTC Corporation) formed in 1968 to spearhead industrial growth. A site was chosen atop an 80-foot-long hill commanding sweeping views of the area and a design competition was held in 1969. The winner, selected from 34 entries, was Architects Team 3 led by pioneer architect Datuk Seri Lim Chong Keat, who designed many significant buildings in the 1960s and 1970s including the Singapore Conference Hall.
