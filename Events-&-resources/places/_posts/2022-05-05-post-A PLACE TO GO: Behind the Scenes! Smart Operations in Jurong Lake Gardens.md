Jurong Lake Gardens is Singapore’s first national gardens situated in the heartlands. 

Jurong Lake Gardens takes pride in using smart technology to enable sustainable operations in the Gardens. The Gardens serves as a testbed for green innovation that seeks to reduce environmental impact.

Keep a lookout for these smart ideas that contribute towards sustainability outcomes and efficient operations that make visiting Jurong Lake Gardens an environmentally friendly, safe, and comfortable experience for everyone.

This 11-seater autonomous vehicle (AV) is part of a people mover system trial at Lakeside Garden. Deployed by NParks in collaboration with ST Engineering Solutions and Willers Pte Ltd, the trial is to test the efficacy, sustainability and safety of visitors riding driverless vehicles in the Garden. 

This is the first time that an AV is being tested in a public garden in the heartlands of Singapore. If successful, we could look forward to enhanced accessibility for elderly visitors and families with young children, so that they may enjoy the attractions at Jurong Lake Gardens with greater ease!

**Safety Robots on the Look Out**

The next time you get lost in Jurong Lake Gardens, a robot may just help you find your way!

NParks works with partners such as Ngee Ann Polytechnic, IMDA and Xjera Labs to conduct trials of autonomous security and surveillance robots. 

The aim of deploying robots is to reduce the reliance on security manpower and improve response time to security situations. 

These robots are equipped with cameras and video analytics capabilities to detect and alert NParks staff to incidents such as drone flying, fishing in non-designated zones and faulty facilities. 

The robots will also be on the lookout for visitor safety and comfort, by providing concierge services such as wayfinding directions to attractions and communicating with security staff in the event of an emergency.

**Smooth Operations**

How do you keep sight of 90 hectares of gardens 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? 

The staff at Jurong Lake Gardens can do just that with the help of an integrated Garden Management System (GMS). 

The GMS consists of a central monitoring and control system, that integrates a suite of environmental and facility monitoring sensor systems.

The Garden Management System allows staff to keep tabs on the functionality of smart sensors installed around the gardens and also the security of Jurong Lake Gardens all in one place. 

This is the first time such a system is implemented in a park or garden. 

The GMS facilitates staff in monitoring park, building and transport operations, and even allows them to respond to ground situations remotely. For example, building equipment can be remotely controlled and the location of the transport fleet remotely tracked through GPS. 

The GMS also contributes towards sustainable outcomes for Jurong Lake Gardens. For example, the weather monitoring system allows for smart decisions that automatically reduce irrigation in wet weather.  The GMS can also monitor electricity and water usage and alert the staff to any water leakage.
