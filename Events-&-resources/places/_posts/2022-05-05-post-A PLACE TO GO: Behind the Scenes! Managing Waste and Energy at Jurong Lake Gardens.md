Jurong Lake Gardens is Singapore’s first national gardens situated in the heartlands. 

Jurong Lake Gardens takes pride in using smart technology to enable sustainable operations in the Gardens. The Gardens serves as a testbed for green innovation that seeks to reduce environmental impact.

Keep a lookout for these smart ideas that contribute towards sustainability outcomes and efficient operations that make visiting Jurong Lake Gardens an environmentally friendly, safe, and comfortable experience for everyone.

**Zero Energy Buildings**

Jurong Lake Gardens aspires to be a showcase for sustainability. 

When the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) launched the new Green Mark scheme for Super Low Energy (SLE) and Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB), the Gardens took up the challenge of operating its main buildings with zero energy. 

Together with the National Environment Agency (NEA), NParks is implementing a Waste-to-Energy system to convert the Gardens’ horticultural waste into electricity to power these buildings. 

Apart from electricity, horticultural waste will be converted into biochar for use in the Gardens. Thermal energy generated in the process can also be used to power water heaters. 

**Buildings that Convert Solar Energy into Electricity**

Can buildings be designed to generate clean energy? 

Perovskite Glass-integrated Photovoltaic (GIPV) is a new method of embedding solar cells in glass panes to convert solar energy into electricity. 

This method allows for customised perovskite shapes and patterns to be printed and incorporated into the glass panes, which can then be used as part of the building façade or roof.

**A Smarter Way towards Clean Energy**

Currently, Singapore’s power grid is AC (alternating current) while solar panels and electric vehicles or electronic devices run on DC (direct current).

Jurong Lake Gardens is testing new solid-state transformer (SST) technology that can provide a bi-directional interface for AC and DC power. This would enable energy to be generated more efficiently through solar panels and for the seamless transfer of clean energy to electric vehicles. 

The SST pilot is a collaboration amongst NParks, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), JTC, SP Group and ST Engineering.  

If successful, new SST technology could potentially be rolled out island wide and contribute towards Singapore’s sustainability outcomes.
