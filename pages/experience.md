<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">A district of gardens and water</h3>

<!--<img style="float: right; width:50%; padding:0px 20px 20px;" src="/images/jld_neramstreamscrop.jpg">-->
Jurong Lake District will have more than 100 hectares of park and greenery, and a 70-hectare lake with more than 10 kilometres of active waterfront.

Throughout the district, streets are lined with canopy trees, forming green corridors that provide shade and act as nature ways for wildlife.

A central green spine will link every development to the edge of Jurong Lake, drawing in parks and forests to cool the urban spaces.

Water-sensitive urban design promotes climate resilience by channeling excess stormwater from urban spaces into the surrounding Jurong Lake.

A recreation corridor with active public spaces will link Jurong Town Hall to the existing Science Centre building.

These distinctive landmark buildings will take on new uses, continue to anchor the district and create a strong sense of place. They could become centres for co-working, innovation, museums, art studios, theatres, event grounds and playscapes with open spaces for the  community to enjoy.
