<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">A place to redefine live, work and play</h3>

Jurong Lake District is ideal for the next generation of businesses and talent to redesign the way we live, work, play and learn.

At Jurong Gateway, residences at J-Gateway and offices at JEM, Westgate and Vision Exchange connect seamlessly to popular malls and major transport nodes. Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability offers programmes for continuous learning, and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital serve the communityâ€™s healthcare needs.

New inspiring work campuses that seamlessly integrate with parks, cafes, restaurants, retail, schools and homes will capitalise on the existing infrastructure to appeal to diverse and modern lifestyles.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Convenient city living in 10-minute neighbourhoods</h3>

Jurong Lake District will be a collection of complete neighbourhoods, where everything is within 10 minutes by foot, cycling or public transport. 

Lively campuses will house business and residential communities, where people meet and interact in generous open spaces and an attractive public realm. Throughout the district, retail, entertainment, healthcare, education, sports and fitness will all be within easy reach.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">A district of gardens and water</h3>

<img src="/images/jld_neramstreamscrop.jpg" style="float: right; width:50%; padding:0px 20px 20px;">Jurong Lake District will have more than 100 hectares of park and greenery, and a 70-hectare lake with 17 kilometres of active waterfront.

Throughout the district, streets are lined with canopy trees, forming green corridors that provide shade and act as nature ways for wildlife.

A central green spine will link every development to the edge of Jurong Lake, drawing in parks and forests to cool the urban spaces.

Water-sensitive urban design promotes climate resilience by channeling excess stormwater from urban spaces into the surrounding Jurong Lake.

Jurong Lake Gardens provides opportunities for birdwatching and nature walks among vast grasslands and restored wetlands.

In 2021, Lakeside Garden won an Urban Land Institute Asia Pacific Award for Excellence.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Signature attractions at the lake</h3>

Unique attractions will surround Jurong Lake, adding to the variety of recreation and water activities around the lake.

From 2023 to 2028, the redeveloped Chinese and Japanese Gardens, the New Science Centre and a future tourism development will be progressively completed and line the waterfront with exciting leisure and entertainment offerings.

A recreation corridor with active public spaces will link Jurong Town Hall to the existing Science Centre.

These heritage landmarks will take on new uses, continue to anchor the district and create a strong sense of place. They could become centres for co-working, innovation, museums, art studios, theatres, event grounds and playscapes with open spaces for the  community to enjoy.
