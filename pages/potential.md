The area around Jurong East MRT station today comprises offices, retail and institution uses. By 2028, more offices and community uses, a new Jurong Region Line station and an integrated transport hub will be built next to Jurong East MRT station.

A new district 120-ha precinct will connect seamlessly to the existing commercial centre and existing MRT station via elevated pedestrian linkages and lushly planted streets. It will have a mix of offices, housing and amenities in a car-lite and park setting. With more flexibility in zoning, land tenure and phasing compared to other districts, companies can experiment with new development concepts and innovative ways to integrate live, work and play.

Jurong Lake District will be the focus of new development in the next two decades, with the government prioritising the sale of sites within the district.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">A dynamic ecosystem to grow your business </h3>

The West Region is also home to Singapore’s top two universities, providing a deep talent pool. Tuas Port, Jurong Innovation District and one-north are close by, making Jurong Lake District the ideal location to tap on academia for cutting-edge R&D, and to provide business and professional services to the maritime and high-value industries.

As the district grows, an ecosystem of innovation, collaboration and synergy within the region will emerge. Jurong Lake District will be a base for companies with strong Environment, Social, Governance (ESG) ambitions to tap on the West Region for opportunities in sustainability businesses. 

By 2040 to 2050, Jurong Lake District will have 100,000 new jobs and 20,000 new homes, adding to the 1 million residents already in the West Region. 

A new, broad planning approach will be adopted for Jurong Lake District where flexi-use sites will be interspersed with business park uses. This will allow companies to locate all
their activities and teams in one place. Large sites will give developers the flexibility to create scalable campuses tailored to business needs at competitive rents.


<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Fast connections to major hubs</h3>

Jurong Lake District will have excellent connectivity via two new train lines, Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line, which will be fully completed by 2029 and in 2030s, respectively. Together with the existing East-West Line and North-South Line, these new lines will connect people to major business centres and education hubs in the West and Central regions within 30 minutes. Developments in Jurong Lake District will be within 10 minutes walk from an MRT station.

Jurong Region Line will link the district to academic expertise, R&D and skilled talent at Nanyang Technological University, Jurong Innovation District and Jurong Industrial Estate, where many high value-add industries are located. The Cross Island Line will serve existing and future developments in the eastern, western, and north-eastern corridors, connecting Jurong Lake District to other major hubs such as Punggol Digital District and the Changi region.
