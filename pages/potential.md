<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Our next largest business district</h3>

Jurong Lake District will be the largest of all business districts outside of the central area.

The new district will have more than 120 hectares of land available for development over the next 30 years. With more flexibility in zoning, land tenure and phasing compared to other districts, companies can experiment with new development concepts and innovative ways to integrate live, work and play.

Jurong Lake District will be the focus of new development in the next two decades, with the government prioritising the sale of sites within the district.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">A dynamic ecosystem to grow your business </h3>

The West Region is also home to Singaporeâ€™s top two universities, providing a deep talent pool. Tuas Port, Jurong Innovation District and one-north are close by, making Jurong Lake District the ideal location to tap on academia, port and maritime industries.

As the district grows, an ecosystem of innovation, collaboration and synergy within the region will emerge.

By 2040 to 2050, Jurong Lake District will have 100,000 new jobs and 20,000 new homes, adding to the 1 million residents already in the West Region. 

A new, broad planning approach will be adopted for Jurong Lake District where flexi-use sites will be interspersed with business parks. This will allow companies to locate all
their activities and teams in one place. Large sites will give developers the flexibility to create scalable campuses tailored to business needs at competitive rents.
