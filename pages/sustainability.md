<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Primed for the green economy </h3>

At Jurong Lake District, residents and businesses will collectively shape a sustainable future through shared goals, higher standards and ready technology.

Identified as a model for urban sustainability under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the district will support Singapore’s ambition to be a carbon services hub and a leading centre for green finance in Asia and globally.

Envisaged to attract a new generation of firms from the technology, e-commerce, sustainability and business services sectors, Jurong Lake District will be the epicentre to support talent and companies in creating new growth and new jobs in green innovation.

In this government-supported Built Environment Living Lab, companies can conveniently co-locate R&amp;D and commercial trials in one place to facilitate faster lab-to-market prototyping and scaling.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Green buildings and communities </h3>

Buildings in Jurong Lake District will be planet-friendly, healthy and creatively designed to replace 100% of their footprint in landscaping and greenery.

Developments will meet higher environmental standards by incorporating green materials and solar panels into their designs, and by being minimally certified Green Mark Super Low Energy. 

Biophilic design will create pleasant indoor environments for better health and well-being.

Residents and workers can be part of a green community that grows its own gardens, fruits and vegetables in community plots, and aspires towards higher levels of reducing waste through sharing, reusing and recycling. 


<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Seamless, driverless, carbonless journeys</h3>

Jurong Lake District has high ambitions for green mobility.

</span>

Planned to be car-lite, 85% of all trips to and within the district will be on Walk-Cycle-Ride modes.

New roads in the district will have cycling paths. Some roads will be transit-priority corridors accessible only to buses, bicycles and pedestrians.

People can walk to their destinations comfortably along the J-Walk, an elevated weather-proof pedestrian network that links buildings, transit stations and public spaces throughout the district.

Jurong Lake District will be autonomous vehicle (AV)- and electric vehicle (EV)-ready. Parking infrastructure in new developments will be well-sized, conveniently sited and designed to have dedicated pick-up drop-off and charge points for a seamless and efficient transport experience. 

New developments will also be designed to support emerging technologies such as the use of Autonomous Mobile Robots for last-mile deliveries.


<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Centralised infrastructure for sustainable outcomes</h3>

Embedded from the start, centralised district infrastructure will optimise the use of land and energy resources across Jurong Lake District.

Common services tunnels will house district cooling and pneumatic waste conveyance systems to deliver cleaner and more efficient urban services to all buildings. These underground systems also make our streetscape more pleasant by eliminating the need to dig up the roads to lay utilities.

Businesses can tap on these urban technologies to operate more efficiently and sustainably, and collectively demonstrate a greener way of life in an innovative district.
