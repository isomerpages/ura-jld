Identified as a model for urban sustainability under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the district will support Singapore’s ambition to be a carbon services hub and a leading centre for green finance in Asia and globally.

Envisaged to attract a new generation of firms from the technology, e-commerce, sustainability and business services sectors, Jurong Lake District will be the epicentre to support talent and companies in creating new growth and new jobs in green innovation.

Government agencies leading Singapore's sustainability, environmental, development and transport strategies are planning their move to Jurong Lake District in phases, attesting to the government's commitment to making the district a demonstration for sustainable growth. 

The district also acts as a "living lab" and regulatory sandbox, providing opportunities to pilot new urban solutions and refine sustainability-centric initiatives. The district has received interest to pilot proposals such as ecologically-friendly leisure facilities, structures made from sustainable construction materials, horticulture-waste-to-energy plants and flight trials for unmanned aircraft systems.  

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Building a model sustainable district </h3>

Jurong Lake District aspires to be a model sustainable district. 

The six pillars encapsulate our ambitions for the district to achieve our net-zero emissions goal by 2050 or earlier.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Pursuing sustainable transport </h3>

Jurong Lake District has high ambitions for green mobility.

By the 2030s, Jurong Lake District will be served by four MRT lines. At least 85% of all trips are targeted to be made by Walk-Cycle-Ride modes of transport by 2035.

Key roads will be designed as Transit Priority Corridors, with bus-only usage lane, wider footpaths and cycling paths.

</span>

Car parking provisions will also be lowered to reduce traffic and create a people-friendly environment. 

The district will be designed to readily support autonomous vehicles for both passengers and goods. To encourage the electrification of private vehicles, EV charging points will be progressively deployed across the district.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Enabling healthy living & building a city in nature</h3>

More than 100 hectares of land in Jurong Lake District has been set aside for parks and green spaces.

New buildings will achieve 100% landscape replacement, where greenery lost through development will be fully replaced by vertical greenery, sky terraces and landscaping.

Thermal comfort, wind flow and shade analyses will be conducted at the development design phase to combat urban heat island effect, reduce energy consumed for cooling and create a comfortable environment for occupants.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Towards net zero emissions and zero waste</h3>

Embedded from the start, centralised district infrastructure will optimise the use of land and energy resources across Jurong Lake District.

All new buildings will be required to minimally achieve Green Mark Platinum (Super Low Energy) certification and connect to the District Cooling System. 

Common services tunnels will house District Cooling and District Pneumatic Waste Conveyance Systems to deliver cleaner and more efficient urban services to all buildings. These underground systems also make our streetscape more pleasant by eliminating the need to dig up the road to lay utilities.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Advancing sustainability through partnership and innovation</h3>

Sustainability alliances will be formed among existing stakeholders in the district to adopt and share best practices, and work together to deploy solutions that address commonly encountered issues. 

Businesses can tap on urban technologies to operate more efficiently and sustainably, and collectively demonstrate a greener way of life in an innovative district.
