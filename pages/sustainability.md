At Jurong Lake District, residents and businesses will collectively shape a sustainable future through shared goals, higher standards and ready technology.

Identified as a model for urban sustainability under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the district will support Singapore’s ambition to be a carbon services hub and a leading centre for green finance in Asia and globally.

Envisaged to attract a new generation of firms from the technology, e-commerce, sustainability and business services sectors, Jurong Lake District will be the epicentre to support talent and companies in creating new growth and new jobs in green innovation.

Government agencies leading Singapore's sustainability, environmental, development and transport strategies are planning their move to Jurong Lake District in phases, attesting to the government's commitment to making the district a demonstration for sustainable growth. 

In this government-supported Built Environment Living Lab, companies can conveniently co-locate R&amp;D and commercial trials in one place to facilitate faster lab-to-market prototyping and scaling. The district receives interest and supports private-sector pilots in innovations such as ecologically-friendly leisure facilities, structures made from sustainable construction materials, horticulture-waste-to-energy plants and flight trials for unmanned aircraft systems.  

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Green buildings and communities </h3>

Buildings in Jurong Lake District will be planet-friendly, healthy and creatively designed to replace 100% of their footprint in landscaping and greenery.

Developments will meet higher environmental standards by incorporating green materials and solar panels into their designs, and by being minimally certified Green Mark Super Low Energy. 

Biophilic design will create pleasant indoor environments for better health and well-being. Green leases will encourage higher ownership and accountability for sustainable behaviour between all users in a building. 

Residents and workers can be part of a green community that grows its own gardens, fruits and vegetables in community plots, and aspires towards higher levels of reducing waste through sharing, reusing and recycling. 


<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Seamless, driverless, carbonless journeys</h3>

Jurong Lake District has high ambitions for green mobility.

</span>

Planned to be car-lite, at least 85% of all trips are targeted to be made by Walk-Cycle-Ride modes of transport by 2035. 

New roads in the district will be planned with dedicated cycling paths to encourage people to cycle and use greener active mobility options. Some roads within the district will also be designed as Transit Priority Corridors that will be accessible only to buses, bicycles, and pedestrians. 

People can walk to their destinations comfortably along the J-Walk, an elevated weather-proof pedestrian network that links buildings, transit stations and public spaces throughout the district. 

Jurong Lake District will be planned to readily support autonomous vehicles (AV) for both passengers and goods. New developments will have dedicated pick-up drop-off points that are well-sized, conveniently sited and designed to create a seamless and efficient transport experience. Electric vehicle (EV) charging points will be progressively deployed in all developments and HDB carparks in the district. 

New developments will also be designed to support emerging technologies such as the use of Autonomous Mobile Robots for last-mile deliveries. 


<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Centralised infrastructure for sustainable outcomes</h3>

Embedded from the start, centralised district infrastructure will optimise the use of land and energy resources across Jurong Lake District.

Common services tunnels will house district cooling and pneumatic waste conveyance systems to deliver cleaner and more efficient urban services to all buildings. These underground systems also make our streetscape more pleasant by eliminating the need to dig up the road to lay utilities. 

Businesses can tap on these urban technologies to operate more efficiently and sustainably, and collectively demonstrate a greener way of life in an innovative district.
