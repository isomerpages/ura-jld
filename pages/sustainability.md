Identified as a model for urban sustainability under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the district will support Singapore’s ambition to be a carbon services hub and a leading centre for green finance in Asia and globally.

Envisaged to attract a new generation of firms from the technology, e-commerce, sustainability and business services sectors, Jurong Lake District will be the epicentre to support talent and companies in creating new growth and new jobs in green innovation.

Government agencies leading Singapore's sustainability, environmental, development and transport strategies are planning their move to Jurong Lake District in phases, attesting to the government's commitment to making the district a demonstration for sustainable growth. 

The district also acts as a "living lab" and regulatory sandbox, providing opportunities to pilot new urban solutions and refine sustainability-centric initiatives. The district has received interest to pilot proposals such as autonomous vehicle trials, ecologically-friendly leisure facilities and structures made from sustainable construction materials.  

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Building a model sustainable district </h3>

Jurong Lake District aspires to be a model sustainable district. 

The six pillars encapsulate our ambitions for the district to achieve our net-zero emissions goal around 2045 for all new developments.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Pursuing sustainable transport </h3>

Jurong Lake District has high ambitions for green mobility.

By 2032, Jurong Lake District will be served by four MRT lines. At least 85% of all trips are targeted to be made by Walk-Cycle-Ride modes of transport by 2035.

</span>

Key roads will be designed as Transit Priority Corridors, with bus-only usage lane, wider footpaths and cycling paths. The bus fleet serving the district will also comprise cleaner energy buses, including fully electric buses that will be deployed on feeder services by 2030.

Car parking provisions will also be lowered to reduce traffic and create a people-friendly environment. 

The district will be designed to readily support autonomous vehicles for both passengers and goods. To encourage the electrification of private vehicles, EV charging points will be progressively deployed across the district.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Enabling healthy living &amp; building a city in nature</h3>

More than 100 hectares of land in Jurong Lake District has been set aside for parks and green spaces.

New buildings will achieve 100% landscape replacement, where greenery lost through development will be fully replaced by vertical greenery, sky terraces and landscaping.

</span>

Thermal comfort, wind flow and shade analyses will be conducted at the development design phase to combat urban heat island effect, reduce energy consumed for cooling and create a comfortable environment for occupants.

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Towards net zero emissions and zero waste</h3>

Embedded from the start, centralised district infrastructure will optimise the use of land and energy resources across Jurong Lake District.

<span style="font-size:12px; font-style:italic;">Artist's impression showing how building design and management can contribute towards achieving net zero emissions. </span>

All new buildings will be required to minimally achieve Green Mark Platinum (Super Low Energy) certification. Where feasible, we will aim for some developments to include Zero Energy Buildings. We will also deploy solar on all suitable surfaces within the district, not only on rooftops or building facades but also on vacant plots of land as a transitory measure to offset the district's emissions while the national grid is decarbonised over time.

Jurong Lake District will be served by the District Cooling and District Pneumatic Waste Conveyance Systems. These systems could be housed in underground Common Services Tunnels to deliver cleaner and more efficient urban services to all buildings, which would also make our streets more pleasant by eliminating the need to dig up the road to lay utilities.

<span style="font-size:12px; font-style:italic;">Artist's impression of how district infrastructure, vehicular circulation, deliveries and servicing will be located at the basement levels, freeing up the ground floor for more vibrant street life. </span>

<h3 style="color:#124596; font-weight:bold;">Advancing sustainability through partnership and innovation</h3>

Sustainability alliances will be formed among existing stakeholders in the district to adopt and share best practices, and work together to deploy solutions that address commonly encountered issues. 

Businesses can tap on urban technologies to operate more efficiently and sustainably, and collectively demonstrate a greener way of life in an innovative district.
