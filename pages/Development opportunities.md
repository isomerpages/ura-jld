STB is looking for integrated development proposals with a compelling mix of attractions, a hotel, retail, F&B and entertainment, with themes focused on technology, edutainment, sustainability and wellness. In line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and Jurong Lake District's position as Singapore's model for urban sustainability, concepts proposed for the tourism development should showcase innovative and sustainable solutions and experiences across all offerings.

Together with Jurong Lake Gardens and the new Science Centre, the tourism development will be the jewel of the new lively and vibrant tourism precinct in Jurong Lake District.
