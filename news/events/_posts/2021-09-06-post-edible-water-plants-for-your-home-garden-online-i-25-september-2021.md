Aquatic plants can be found growing submerged in water as well as moist
soil along the water edge. Besides being ornamental, some aquatic plants are edible
and have cultural associations. In this talk, Dr Wilson Wong will introduce and focus
on a range of edible water plants that are suitable for growing in small spaces in a
high-rise apartment garden. Some of these plants also make interesting ornamental
plants for display in bowls, dishes and even inside your aquarium.
